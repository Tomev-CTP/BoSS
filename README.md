lossy boson sampling.

## Getting Started

So far, to get the project one only needs to download it from this repository (or any other source).

### Prerequisites

To run the scripts there will be needed some version of Python. During development I'm using 3.7, but I believe that
it will also work just fine with some earlier / newer version (at least for now and I cannot guarantee it). 

## Running the tests

TBA...

## Versioning

I'll use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning and try to keep track of the version in the tags.
